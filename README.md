racket-surface3d
================

An extension to Racket's plot function "surface3d" to allow plotting in the x, 
y, and z, dimensions.

The file surface3d-xyz.rkt contains forms (surface3d/x, surface3d/y, surface3d/z) to plot in 
their respectively named dimension. Note: surface3d/z is identical to the current plot function "surface3d".

The file surface3d-xyz-demo.rkt shows drawing three surfaces, one each for part of the x, y, and z, axes around the origin.
